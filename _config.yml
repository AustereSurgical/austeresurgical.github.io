description: "Austere Surgical is pushing the boundary of surgical care in low-resource environments to improve patient outcomes in war zones, natural disasters, and spaceflight. Our portable and reusable system provides stability, sterility, and visibility in remote environments. From offloading minor procedures in overrun hospitals to providing damage control surgery on the move, our system deploys a functional operating room when you need it most."
